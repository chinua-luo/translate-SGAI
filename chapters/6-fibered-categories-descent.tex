\chapter{Fibred Categories and Descent}

\setcounter{section}{-1}

\section{Introduction}

\oldpage{145}Contrary to what was said in the introduction to the previous chapter, it proved impossible to do descent in the category of preschemes, even in special cases, without having already carefully developed the language of descent in general categories.

The notion of ``descent'' provides the general framework for all processes of ``gluing'' objects, and therefore of ``gluing'' of categories. 
The most classic case of gluing relates to the data of a topological space $X$ and a cover of $X$ by open sets $X_i$; if we consider for all $i$ a fibre bundle (say) $E_i$ above $X_i$, and for every pair $(i, j)$ an isomorphism $f_{ji}$ of $E_i| X_{ij}$ on $E_j | X_{ij}$ (where we put $X_{ij} = X_i \cap Xj$), 
satisfying a well-known condition of transitivity (which we write in a short way $f_{kj} f_{ji} = f_{ki}$ ), 
we know that there is a fibre bundle $E$ on $X$, defined up to isomorphism with the condition that we have isomorphisms $f_i \colon E | X_i \xrightarrow{\simeq} E_i$, satisfying the relations $f_{ji} = f_jf_i^{-1}$ (with the usual writing abuse). 
Let $X'$ be the space given by the sum of the $X_i$, which is therefore a fibre space over $X$ (i.e. equipped with a continuous mapping $X' to X$).
We can then more concisely think of the data of the $E_i$ as a fibre bundle $E'$ over $X'$, and the data of the $f_{ji}$ as an isomorphism between the two inverse images (by the two canonical projections) $E_1''$ and $E_2''$ of $E'$ over $X''=X'\times_X X'$, whence the gluing condition can be written as an identity between isomorphisms of fibre bundles $\E_1'''$ and $\E_2'''$ on the triple fibre product $X'''= X' \times_X X' \times_X X'$ (where $E_i'''$ denotes the inverse image of $E'$ on $X'''$ by the canonical projection of index $i$).
The construction of $E$, from $E '$ and $f$, is a typical case of ``descent''.
Moreover, \oldpage{146}starting from a fibre bundle $E$ on $X$, one says that $X$ is ``locally trivial'', of fibre $F$, if there exists an open covering $(X_i)$ of $X$ such that the $E| X_i$ are isomorphic to $F \times X_i$, or, equivalently, such that the inverse image $E'$ of $E$ over $X' = \coprod_i X_i$ is isomorphic to $X'\times F$.

Thus the notion of ``gluing'' objects, like the ``localisation'' of a property, is related to the study of certain types of ``base changes'' $X '\to X$. 
In algebraic geometry many other types of base change, and in particular faithfully flat morphisms $X '\to X$, should be considered as corresponding to a process of ``localisation'' relative to preschemes, or other objects, ``over'' $X$.
This type of localization is used just as much as the simple topological localization (which is a special case of this more general idea). 
The same is true (to a lesser extent) in Analytic Geometry. 

Most proofs, reducing to verifications, are omitted or simply sketched out; if so then we specify the less-obvious diagrams that are needed in the proof.


\section{Universe, Categories, Equivalence of Categories}

To avoid certain logical difficulties, we introduce here the notion of a \emph{Universe}, which is a set ``big enough'' that we do not leave it by the usual operations of set theory; an ``Axiom of Universes'' guarantees that every object is in some universe. 
For details, see a book in preparation by C. Chevalley and the \marginpar{\small The \emph{conférencier} is the master of ceremonies, or chairman, of a conference. In this case (so it would appear) it was P.~Gabriel. [trans.]}conférencier\footnote{The finalised authors are C. Chevalley and P. Gabriel. The book should come out in the year 3000. Whilst waiting, cf. as well SGA~4~I.}. 
Thus the abbreviation $\Ens$ designates, not the category of all sets (a notion that does not make sense), but the category of all sets found in a given Universe (which we omit from the notation). 
Similarly, $\Cat$ will indicate the category of categories in the Universe in question, and the ``morphisms'' from an object $X$ of $\Cat$ to another $Y$ are by definition the \emph{functors} from $X$ to $Y$.

\oldpage{147}If $\C$ is a category, we denote by $\Ob (\C)$ the \emph{set of objects} of $\C$ and by $\Fl (\C)$ the \emph{set of arrows} of $\C$ (or morphisms of $\C$). 
We will then write $X \in \Ob (\C)$, avoiding the current abuse of notation $X \in \C$. 
If $\C$ and $\C'$ are two categories then a \emph{functor} from $\C$ to $\C'$ will always be what is usually called a \emph{covariant functor} from $\C$ to $\C'$; its data implies that of the target category and the source category, $\C$ and $\C'$. The functors from $\C$ to $\C'$ form a set, denoted $\Hom (\C, \C')$, which is the set of objects of a category denoted $\textbf{Hom} (\C, \C')$.
By definition, a \emph{contravariant functor} from $\C$ to $\C'$ is a functor from the \emph{opposite category} $\C^{op}$ of $\C$ to $\C'$.

We also take as given the notion of a \emph{projective limit} and \emph{inductive limit} of a functor $F \colon \I \to \C$, and in particular the most common special cases of this notion:
Cartesian products and fibre products, dual notions of direct sums and amalgamated sums, and the usual formal properties of these operations.

For example, in the category $\Cat$ introduced earlier, the projective limits
(relative to categories found in the chosen Universe) exist; the set of objects (respectively the set of arrows) of the projective limit category $\C$ of the $\C_i$ is obtained by taking the projective limit of sets of objects (resp. arrows) of the categories $\C_i$. The best known case is that of the product of a family of
categories. We will constantly use the fiber product of two categories
over a third.

For everything concerning categories and functors, while waiting for the book already in preparation, see [\textbf{1}] (which is necessarily very incomplete, even concerning the generalities outlined here).

We take this opportunity to explain the concept of equivalence of categories, which is not satisfactorily exposed in [\textbf{1}]. 
A functor $F \colon \C \to \C'$ is said to be \emph{faithful} (resp. \emph{fully faithful}) if, for any pair of objects $S, T$ of $\C$, the function $u \mapsto F (u)$ from $\Hom (S, T)$ to $\Hom (F (S), F (T))$ is injective (respectively bijective). 
We say that $F$ is an \emph{equivalence} of categories if $F$ is fully faithful, and if any object $S'$ of $\C'$ is isomorphic to an object of the form $F (S)$.
We show that it is the same to say that there exists a functor $G$ from $\C'$ to $\C$ that is quasi-inverse of $F$, i.e.\ such that $GF$ is isomorphic to $id_\C$.
When this is so, the data of a functor $G \colon \C' \to \C$ and an isomorphism $\varphi \colon GF \to id_{\C'}$ equals the data, for all $S' \in \Ob (\C')$, of a pair $(S, u)$ consisting of an object $S$ of $\C$ and an isomorphism $u \colon F (S) \to S'$, i.e.\ $(G (S), \varphi (S))$.
(With this notation, there exists a unique functor $C' \to C$ having the given function $S \mapsto G (S)$ as function-objects, and such that the function $S \mapsto \varphi (S)$ is a homomorphism of functors $FG \to id_{\C'}$).
Finally, if $G$ is a quasi-inverse functor of $F$, and if one chooses isomorphisms $\varphi \colon FG \xrightarrow{\sim} id_{\C'}$ and $\psi \colon GF \xrightarrow{sim} id_\C$, then the two compatibility conditions on $\varphi$ and $\psi$ stated in [\textbf{1}, I.1.2] are in fact equivalent to each other, and for every isomorphism $\varphi$ chosen, there exists a unique isomorphism such that these conditions are satisfied.

\section{Cloven Fibration defined from a pseudofunctor}

As an abbreviation, we say \emph{pseudofunctor} of $\E^{op}$ in $\Cat$ (really we should say \emph{normalized} pseudo-functor) to mean a set of data a), b), c) as above, satisfying the conditions A') and B).
In the previous section, we associated a pseudofunctor $\E^{op}\to\Cat$ to a normalized cloven fibration on $\E$, and here we will describe the inverse construction.
We will leave to the reader the verification of most of the details, as well as the fact that these constructions are ``inverse'' to each other. 
Specifically, we should consider the pseudofunctors $\E^{op} \to \Cat$ as the objects of a new category, and show that our constructions provide equivalences, quasi-inverse to each other, between the above and the category of cloven categories above $\E$, as defined in the preceding section.

We write 
\[\F_\circ = \coprod_{S \in \Ob (\E)} \Ob(\F(S)),\] 
the sum of sets $\Ob(\F (S))$ (N.B.\ we will write $\F(S)$ and not $\F_S$ to mean the the value in the object $S$ of $\E$ of the given pseudofunctor to avoid confusion of notation thereafter).
We then have an obvious map:
\[p_\circ \colon \F_\circ \to \Ob \E.\]
Let 
\[\oxi = (S, \xi), \, \oeta = (T, \eta) \qquad (\text{where } \xi \in \Ob \F(S), \, \eta \in \Ob \F(T))\]
be two elements of $\F_\circ$, and let $f \in \Hom(T,S)$.
We then define
\[h_f(\oeta, \oxi) = \Hom_{\F(T)}(\eta, f^\ast(\xi)).\]
\oldpage{176}If we also have a morphism $g \colon U \to T$ in $\E$, and some $\zeta \in \Ob \F (U)$, we define a function, denoted $(u,v) \mapsto u \circ v$:
\[h_f(\oeta, \oxi) \times h_g(\ozeta, \oeta) \to h_{fg}(\ozeta, \oxi),\]
i.e.\ a function
\[Hom_{\F(T)} (\eta, f^\ast(\xi)) \times \Hom_{\F(U)} (\zeta, g^\ast(\eta)) \to \Hom_{\F(U)} (\zeta, (fg)^\ast(\xi)),\]
given by the formula
\[u \circ v = c_{f,g} (\xi) \cdot g^\ast(U) \cdot v,\]
i.e.\ $u \circ v$ is the composition of the sequence 
\[
\zeta \xrightarrow{u} g^\ast(\eta) \xrightarrow{g^\ast(u)} g^\ast f^\ast(\xi) \xrightarrow{c_{f,g}(\xi)} (fg)^\ast(\xi).\]
Further define
\[
    h(\oeta, \oxi) = \coprod_{f \in \Hom(T,S)} h_f(\oeta, \oxi),
\]
and the previous couplings define couplings
\[h(\oeta, \oxi) \times h(\ozeta, \oeta) \to h(\ozeta, \oxi),\]
and the definition of $h (\oeta, \oxi)$ gives an obvious function:
\[p_{\oeta, \oxi}
\colon h(\oeta, \oxi) \to \Hom(T, S).\]
With these definitions, we verify the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \oldpage{177}The composition of elements of $h (\oeta, \oxi)$ is \emph{associative}.
    \item For all $\oxi = (\xi, S)$ in $\F_\circ$, consider the identity element of
    \[h_{id_S} (\oxi, \oxi) = \Hom_{\F(S)} (id_S^\ast(\xi), \xi) = \Hom_{\F(S)}(\xi,\xi),\]
    and its image in $h (\oxi,\oxi)$.
        This object is a left and right unit for the composition of elements of $h (\oeta, \oxi)$.
\end{enumerate}

Already, this shows that we get a category $\F$ by setting
\[\Ob \F = \F_\circ, \quad \Fl \F = \coprod_{\oxi, \oeta \in \F_\circ} h(\oeta, \oxi).\]
(N.B.\ we can not simply take for $\Fl \F$ the union of the sets $h (\oeta, \oxi)$, because these are not necessarily disjoint.).
Furthermore:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item The functions $p_\circ \colon \Ob \F \to \Ob \E$ and $p_1 = (p_{\oeta, \oxi} \colon \Fl\F \to \Fl \E$ define a \emph{functor} $p \colon \F \to \E$. In this way, $\F$ becomes a category over $\E$, and moreover the obvious function $h_f (\oeta, \oxi) \to \Hom (\oeta, \oxi)$ induces a \emph{bijection}
    \[h_f(\oeta, \oxi) \xrightarrow{\sim} \Hom_f(\oeta, \oxi).\]
    \item The obvious functions
    \[\Ob \F(S) \to \F_\circ = \Ob \F, \quad \Fl \F(S) \to \Fl\F,\]
    where the second is defined by the obvious maps
    \[\Hom_{\F(S)} (\xi, \xi') = h_{id_S}(\oxi,\oxi') \to \Hom(\oxi, \oxi'),\]
    define an \emph{isomorphism}
    \[i_S \colon \F(S) \xrightarrow{\sim} \F_S.\]
    \item \oldpage{178}For every object $\oxi = (S, \xi)$ of $\F$, and every morphism $f \colon T \to S$ of $\E$, consider the element $\oeta = (T, \eta)$ of $\F_T$, 
    with $\eta = f^\ast (\xi)$, and $\alpha_f (\xi)$ of $\Hom (\oeta, \oxi)$, the image of $id_{f^\ast (\xi)}$ under the morphism $\Hom_{\F (T)} (f^\ast(\xi), f ^\ast(\xi)) = h_f (\oeta, \oxi) \to \Hom_f (\oeta, \oxi)$.
    \emph{This element is cartesian, and it is the identity in $\xi$ if $f = id_S$}.
    In other words, the set of all $\alpha_f (\xi)$ defines a normalized cleavage of $\F$ over $\E$. 
    Further, by construction, we have commutativity in the diagram of functors
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \F(S)
        \arrow[r, "f^\ast"]
        \arrow[d, "i_S", swap]
        &
        \F(T)
        \arrow[d, "i_T"]
        \\
        \F_S
        \arrow[r, "f^\ast_\F", swap]
        &
        \F_T
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    where $f^\ast_\F$ is the inverse image functor by $f$, relative to the cleavage considered on $\F$. Finally:
    \item the homomorphisms $c_{f, g}$ given by the pseudofunctor are transformed, by the isomorphisms $i_S$, to functorial homomorphisms $c_{f, g}$ associated with the cleavage of $\F$.
\end{enumerate}
We restrict ourselves to giving the verification of 1) (which is, if possible, less trivial than the others). It is enough to prove the associativity of the composition between the objects of the sets of the form $h_f (\oeta, \oxi)$. So consider the morphisms in $\E$
\[
    S \xleftarrow{f} T \xleftarrow{g} U \xleftarrow{h} V
\]
and the objects
\[\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau\]
in $\F (S), \F (T), \F (U), \F (V)$, as well as some elements
\begin{align*}
    &u \in h_f(\oeta, \oxi) = \Hom_{\F(T)} (\eta, f^\ast(\xi))\\
    &v \in h_g(\ozeta, \oeta) = \Hom_{\F(U)} (\zeta, g^\ast(\eta))\\
    &w \in h_h(\otau, \ozeta) = \Hom_{\F(V)} (\tau, h^\ast(\zeta)).
\end{align*}

\oldpage{179}We want to prove the formula
\[(u \circ v) \circ w = u \circ (v \circ w),
\]
which is an equality in $\Hom_{\F (V)} (\tau, (fgh)^\ast(\xi))$. By virtue of the definitions both members of this equality are obtained by composition following the top and bottom arrows of the diagram below:

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    \tau
    \arrow[r, "w"]
    \arrow[rrd, "v \circ w", swap]
    &
    h^\ast(\zeta) 
    \arrow[r, "h^\ast(v)"]
    \arrow[rrr, "h^\ast (u \circ v)", bend left]
    &
    h^\ast g^\ast(\eta)
    \arrow[r, "h^\ast g^\ast (u)"]
    \arrow[d, "c_{g,h}(\eta)", swap]
    &
    h^\ast g^\ast f^\ast (\xi)
    \arrow[r, "h^\ast (c_{f,g}(\xi))"]
    \arrow[d, "c_{g,h}(f^\ast (\xi))"]
    &
    h^\ast (fg)^\ast (\xi)
    \arrow[d, "c_{fg,h}(\xi)"]
    \\&&
    (gh)^\ast (\eta)
    \arrow[r, "(gh)^\ast (\eta)", swap]
    &
    (gh)^\ast f^\ast (\xi)
    \arrow[r, "c_{f,gh}(\xi)", swap]
    &
    (fgh)^\ast (\xi)
\end{tikzcd}\]

Now the middle square is commutative because $c_{g, h}$ is a functorial homomorphism, and the square on the right is commutative under condition B) for a pseudofunctor, whence the desired result.

Of course, it remains to make precise, in the case where the pseudofunctor already comes from a normalized cloven category $\F'$ over $\E$, how we get n natural isomorphism between $\F'$ and $\F$. We leave the details to the reader.

We also allow the reader to interpret, in terms of pseudofunctors, the notion of inverse image of a cloven category $\F$ over $\E$ by a change of base functor $\E'\to \E$.
